Optimisation for Topas
======================

`This repository <https://github.com/image-x-institute/TopasOpt>`_ enables users to transform any radiation transport model in  `TopasMC <http://www.topasmc.org/>`_, into an optimisation problem, hence enabling users to apply the power of formal mathematical optimisation with the well established use cases for Monte Carlo modelling.

To install::

   pip install TopasOpt
   
For help getting an appropriate environment set up, see `here <https://image-x-institute.github.io/TopasOpt/EnvironmentSetup.html>`_
The quickest way to get started is to go through the `worked examples <https://image-x-institute.github.io/TopasOpt/worked_examples.html>`_.
